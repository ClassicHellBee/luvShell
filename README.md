# luvShell: simple shell for unix-like lovers ❤️ 
LuvShell is a shell for unix-like systems designed to be simple and standalone.<br>
It works using basic C libraries and will be the default shell of a future operating system written by me.

## Installation 😫⚙️
On Linux and Unix systems you can install it using gcc.<br>
`gcc luvshell.c -o luvshell && chmod +x luvshell`

## Usage 💻
To run luvShell, boot it like any compiled C program.
`./luvshell`

## Credits ❤️❤️❤️
My love: she has been my inspiration for the name of the project. ❤️
